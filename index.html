      <h3 class="heading"><u> Clean Up At AMA Atyle</u></h3>
      <p class="paragraph">On Saturday, November 9th, 2019 AMA went around all beaches in New York to pick up the garbage and leave it clean. CEOs planned an all paid trip for those students who volunteered to help achieve the goal.
        
        Most Students came from Information Technology High School and the seem to be very hard working students based on the fantastic job they did. Now beaches look nicer than before, let's see for how long people can keep it that way! </p>
